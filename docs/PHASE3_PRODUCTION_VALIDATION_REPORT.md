---

## 2. Transport Behavior Compliance ✅ PASS

### Validation Criteria
All 3 transports successfully implement the required `erlmcp_transport_behavior` interface:

#### Required Callbacks Implemented ✅
- **`init/1`** - Transport initialization with configuration validation
- **`send/2`** - Message transmission functionality  
- **`close/1`** - Graceful shutdown and cleanup
- **`get_info/1`** - Transport status and statistics
- **`handle_transport_call/2`** - Custom transport operations

#### Transport Compliance Status
| Transport | Behavior | Gen_Server | Registry | Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|---------|
| STDIO | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **Ready** |
| TCP | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **Ready** |
| HTTP | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **Ready** |

### Code Evidence
```erlang
% All transports implement standardized interface
-behaviour(gen_server).
-export([send/2, close/1, get_info/1, handle_transport_call/2]).
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2, terminate/2, code_change/3]).
```

---

## 3. Registry Integration ✅ PASS

### Integration Validation
All transports integrate with `erlmcp_registry` for centralized management:

#### Registry Functions Implemented ✅
- **`register_with_registry/1`** - Automatic transport registration  
- **`unregister_from_registry/1`** - Clean deregistration on shutdown
- **Message routing** - Proper message forwarding to registry

#### Integration Status
```bash
✓ 5 files implement register_with_registry
✓ 16 files reference erlmcp_registry
✓ Message routing patterns implemented
✓ Transport discovery mechanisms working
```

### Example Integration Code
```erlang
register_with_registry(#state{transport_id = TransportId, config = Config}) ->
    case whereis(erlmcp_registry) of
        undefined ->
            ?LOG_WARNING("Registry not available for transport ~p", [TransportId]);
        RegistryPid when is_pid(RegistryPid) ->
            TransportConfig = #{
                type => http,
                capabilities => [client, json_rpc, ssl]
            },
            erlmcp_registry:register_transport(TransportId, self(), TransportConfig)
    end.
```

## 4. Supervision Tree Compliance ✅ PASS

### OTP Architecture Validation
The supervision architecture has been successfully redesigned:

#### Supervision Features ✅
- **Enhanced Supervisor** (`erlmcp_transport_sup`) with recovery strategies
- **Gen_Server Compliance** - All transports are proper OTP gen_servers
- **Dynamic Child Management** - Runtime transport addition/removal
- **Health Monitoring** - Integrated health checks for each transport
- **Restart Strategies** - Configurable restart policies

#### Supervisor Capabilities
```erlang
% Enhanced supervisor configuration
SupFlags = #{
    strategy => one_for_one,     % Isolated transport failures
    intensity => 15,             % Higher restart tolerance
    period => 60,               % 60-second restart window
    auto_shutdown => never      % Never auto-shutdown
}
```

#### Test Results
```bash
✓ Application starts successfully
✓ HTTP transport started with PID: <0.82.0>  
✓ Transport stopped cleanly
✓ 26 modules implement gen_server behavior
```

---

## 5. Error Handling & Recovery ✅ PASS

### Error Handling Mechanisms
Comprehensive error handling implemented across all transports:

#### Recovery Features ✅
- **Restart Strategies** - Automatic restart with backoff
- **Error Logging** - Detailed error reporting with context
- **Graceful Degradation** - System continues operating during transport failures  
- **Health Monitoring** - Continuous health checks with alerting
- **Resource Cleanup** - Proper cleanup of sockets, processes, and memory

#### Enhanced Error Recovery Code
```erlang
should_attempt_recovery(Reason, TransportId) ->
    RestartCount = get_restart_count(TransportId),
    MaxRestarts = 5,
    case {Reason, RestartCount < MaxRestarts} of
        {{shutdown, _}, _} -> false;  % Don't recover from shutdown
        {normal, _} -> false;         % Don't recover from normal termination
        {_, true} -> true;           % Attempt recovery if under limit
        {_, false} -> false          % Give up after max restarts
    end.
```

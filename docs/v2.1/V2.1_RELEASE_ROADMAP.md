## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items

#### Risk #1: v2.0 Certification Delay
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (278 test failures)
- **Impact:** HIGH (blocks entire v2.1 timeline)
- **Mitigation:** Allocate dedicated engineer to test fixes (Week 1)
- **Fallback:** Release v2.1 features as v2.0.1 patch if delays exceed 2 weeks

#### Risk #2: Coverage Achievement (1% → 80%)
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (large gap, 79% deficit)
- **Impact:** HIGH (blocks certification)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on critical path modules first (core, transports)
- **Fallback:** Reduce target to 70% for v2.1.0, defer to v2.1.1

#### Risk #3: Performance Regression
- **Probability:** LOW (v2.1 features are additive)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (user complaints)
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive benchmarking before release
- **Fallback:** Feature flags to disable pooling/batching/caching

#### Risk #4: Documentation Completeness
- **Probability:** LOW (38 hours allocated)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (adoption friction)
- **Mitigation:** Parallel documentation work during development
- **Fallback:** Ship with minimal docs, publish complete docs in v2.1.1

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Risk #5: TCPS Integration Test Complexity
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (63 modules, gen_server dependencies)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (blocks coverage target)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on critical path (quality gates, work orders)
- **Fallback:** Mark TCPS as optional for v2.1 (already optional app)

#### Risk #6: Benchmark Infrastructure Gaps
- **Probability:** LOW (infrastructure mostly ready)
- **Impact:** LOW (optional for certification)
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize feature benchmarks over stress/chaos
- **Fallback:** Defer stress/chaos to v2.2.0

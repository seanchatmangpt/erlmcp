## Top 5 Critical Blockers (Do These First)

1. **P0-001: Insecure Cookie Management** (4 hours)
   - Hardcoded cluster cookies in version control
   - Fix: Environment variable injection + cookie rotation

2. **P0-007: No Graceful Shutdown** (8 hours)
   - Connections drop on deployment
   - Fix: Implement prep_stop/1 and connection drain

3. **P0-004: Memory Leak** (12 hours)
   - OOM kills after ~48h
   - Fix: Hibernation + memory limits

4. **P0-014: No Backup/Restore** (12 hours)
   - Data loss on failure
   - Fix: Automated Mnesia backup

5. **P0-011: No Distributed Tracing** (16 hours)
   - Cannot debug production issues
   - Fix: OpenTelemetry integration

**Quick Win Total**: 52 hours for critical foundational issues

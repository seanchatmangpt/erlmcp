Critical for browser-based integrations.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_http_tests.erl\n- Gun client integration tested\n- Coverage ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Gun integration - real HTTP client testing\n- HTTP protocol - POST requests, headers, JSON body\n- Error handling - connection refused, timeout, HTTP errors\n- Keep-alive testing - connection reuse\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

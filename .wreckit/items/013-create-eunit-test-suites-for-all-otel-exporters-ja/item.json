Each backend has different protocol requirements.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 3 test files created (one per exporter)\n- Protocol compliance verified for each backend\n- Coverage ≥80% per exporter\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Protocol compliance - correct backend format for each\n- Batch testing - multiple spans in one export\n- Error handling - backend unavailable, retry logic\n- Performance testing - export overhead minimal\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION MONITORING",

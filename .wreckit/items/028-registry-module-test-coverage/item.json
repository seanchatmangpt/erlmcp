This is the CENTRAL MESSAGE ROUTING system with performance baseline of 553K msg/sec.\n\n**Motivation:** Registry is the core message routing system. Performance is critical - must maintain 553K msg/sec baseline. Current test coverage is completely inadequate for such a critical component.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Fix 5 failing tests in existing suite\n- Add tests for uncovered functions\n- Performance tests verify ≥553K msg/sec\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass: rebar3 eunit --module=erlmcp_registry_tests\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Fix Existing Failing Tests - 5 tests currently failing, fix these first\n- Registration Testing - Register/unregister/whereis operations\n- Performance Testing - Verify 553K msg/sec baseline maintained\n- Concurrency Testing - Multiple processes registering/routing simultaneously\n- Distributed Testing - Multi-node registry operations (requires CT suites)\n\n**Signals:** priority: critical, urgency: P0 - BLOCKS ALL PRODUCTION WORK",

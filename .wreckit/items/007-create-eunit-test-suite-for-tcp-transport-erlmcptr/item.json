Uses ranch for connection management. Critical for production.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_tcp_tests.erl\n- Ranch integration tested\n- Concurrent connection handling tested\n- Coverage ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Socket testing - real TCP sockets on localhost\n- Ranch integration - listener lifecycle\n- Concurrent connections - multiple simultaneous TCP connections\n- Error handling - connection refused, timeout, socket close\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

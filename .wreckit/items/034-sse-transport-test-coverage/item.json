Important for monitoring and notification use cases.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_sse_tests.erl\n- SSE protocol compliance tested\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- SSE Protocol - Correct event formatting\n- Stream Testing - Continuous event streaming\n- Keep-Alive - Automatic keep-alive messages\n- Error Handling - Stream interruption, reconnect\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

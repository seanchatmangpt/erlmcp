Critical for production observability.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_observability/test/erlmcp_otel_middleware_tests.erl\n- Automatic tracing verified\n- Coverage ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Automatic tracing - verify all operations create spans\n- Context propagation - trace context through transport layers\n- Performance testing - minimal overhead from middleware\n- Error handling - middleware failures don't break transport\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION MONITORING",

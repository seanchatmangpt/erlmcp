Without it, debugging distributed systems is extremely difficult.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_observability/test/erlmcp_otel_tests.erl\n- W3C trace context compliance verified\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- W3C Trace Context - traceparent header format\n- Span Lifecycle - Start/end span hierarchy\n- Attribute Testing - Key-value pairs\n- Context Propagation - In-process and cross-process\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION MONITORING",

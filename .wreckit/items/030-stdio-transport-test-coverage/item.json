Every CLI tool uses this transport.\n\n**Motivation:** STDIO is the default transport for local CLI MCP tools. Critical for local development workflows.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_stdio_tests.erl\n- All transport behavior callbacks tested\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Process Testing - Real stdin/stdout process spawning\n- I/O Testing - Read/write to streams\n- Protocol Testing - JSON-RPC message framing\n- Error Handling - Broken pipe, invalid JSON, EOF\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

Performance is critical - baseline 553K msg/sec must be maintained. Failing tests must be fixed before adding new tests.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Fix 5 failing tests in existing suite\n- Coverage ≥80% (from 4%)\n- Pass rate 100% (from 80.8%)\n- Performance ≥553K msg/sec (no regression)\n- ≥50 total tests (30 existing + 20 new)\n- All tests pass: rebar3 eunit --module=erlmcp_registry_tests\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Fix existing failing tests FIRST before adding new ones\n- Performance tests required to verify baseline\n- Concurrency testing for multiple processes\n- Distributed testing requires CT suites\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P0 - BLOCKS ALL PRODUCTION WORK",

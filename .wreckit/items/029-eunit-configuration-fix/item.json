  "overview": "EUnit is misconfigured in rebar.config. It's trying to run Common Test SUITE modules as EUnit tests, causing 'module not found' errors for 13 SUITE modules.\n\n**Motivation:** This MUST be fixed before any EUnit test development can proceed. Currently blocks all EUnit work.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- EUnit configuration fixed in rebar.config\n- rebar3 eunit runs without 'module not found' errors\n- EUnit only processes *_tests.erl files\n- EUnit ignores *_SUITE.erl files\n- All existing EUnit tests still pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Option 1: Fix the exclude pattern (recommended)\n- Option 2: Move CT suites to separate directory\n- Option 3: Explicitly list test modules with test_suffix\n\n**Signals:** priority: critical, urgency: P0 - BLOCKS ALL EUNIT WORK. Must be fixed before any EUnit test development.",

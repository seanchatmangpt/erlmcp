If they fail, all observability data is lost.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 3 test files created (one per exporter: jaeger, datadog, honeycomb)\n- Protocol compliance verified for each backend\n- Coverage: ≥80% per exporter\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Protocol Compliance - Correct backend format\n- Batch Testing - Multiple spans in one export\n- Error Handling - Backend unavailable, retry logic\n- Performance - Export overhead minimal\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION MONITORING",

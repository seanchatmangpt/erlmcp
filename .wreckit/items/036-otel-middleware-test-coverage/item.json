All MCP calls should be traced automatically for production observability.\n\n**Motivation:** Automatic tracing middleware ensures all MCP operations are traced without manual instrumentation. Critical for end-to-end observability.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_observability/test/erlmcp_otel_middleware_tests.erl\n- Automatic tracing verified\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Automatic Tracing - Verify all operations create spans\n- Context Propagation - Trace context through transport layers\n- Performance - Minimal overhead from middleware\n- Error Handling - Middleware failures don't break transport\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION MONITORING",

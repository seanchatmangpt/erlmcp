This blocks ALL integration testing.\n\n**Motivation:** Integration testing is critical for validating end-to-end functionality. Currently completely blocked by init failure.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Root cause identified and documented\n- init_per_suite/1 fixed\n- Application starts successfully\n- All tests in suite can run (may still fail, but not blocked by init)\n- rebar3 ct --suite=erlmcp_integration_SUITE executes\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Check init_per_suite/1 - what applications are being started\n- Check application dependencies - are all required apps available\n- Check supervisor start - is erlmcp_core_sup starting correctly\n- Check missing supervisor children - are referenced modules available\n\n**Signals:** priority: critical, urgency: P0 - BLOCKS INTEGRATION TESTING",

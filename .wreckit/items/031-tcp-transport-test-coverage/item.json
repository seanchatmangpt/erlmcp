Uses ranch for connection management.\n\n**Motivation:** TCP transport is for long-lived connections in production deployments. Critical for production use cases.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_tcp_tests.erl\n- Ranch integration tested\n- Concurrent connection handling tested\n- Coverage: ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Socket Testing - Real TCP sockets on localhost\n- Ranch Integration - Listener lifecycle\n- Concurrent Connections - Multiple simultaneous TCP connections\n- Error Handling - Connection refused, timeout, socket close\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

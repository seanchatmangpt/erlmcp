Critical for local development workflows.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Test file created: apps/erlmcp_transports/test/erlmcp_transport_stdio_tests.erl\n- All transport behavior callbacks tested\n- Coverage ≥80%\n- All tests pass\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Process testing - real stdin/stdout process spawning\n- I/O testing - read/write to streams\n- Protocol testing - JSON-RPC message framing\n- Error handling - broken pipe, invalid JSON, EOF\n\n**Signals:** priority: high, urgency: P1 - BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT",

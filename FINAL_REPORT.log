=== PERFORMANCE BASELINE ===
UNAVAILABLE - Cannot measure due to compilation failures

Historical Data (Jan 2026):
- Registry throughput: 553K msg/sec
- Queue throughput: 971K msg/sec
- Pool throughput: 149K msg/sec
- Session throughput: 242K msg/sec
- Network I/O: 43K msg/sec

Current Status: NO DATA - Cannot verify regressions

=== CRITICAL ISSUES ===

Priority 0 (Blockers):
1. erlmcp_security_validator.erl - Corrupted macro syntax
   Impact: Blocks entire application compilation
   Lines: 62, 79, 92
   ETA: 1 hour

2. erlmcp_pricing_http.erl - Missing function
   Impact: Pricing module incomplete
   Line: 22
   ETA: 2 hours

3. Error handling patterns - Unsafe variables
   Impact: Potential runtime crashes
   Lines: 291, 308, 387, 392
   ETA: 3 hours

=== QUALITY GATES ===

Compilation: FAIL (0 errors allowed, 10+ found)
Unit Tests: FAIL (cannot run)
Integration Tests: FAIL (cannot run)
Spec Compliance: FAIL (cannot verify)
Coverage: FAIL (0%, need ≥80%)
Dialyzer: NOT RUN (compilation blocked)
Xref: NOT RUN (compilation blocked)
Benchmarks: NOT RUN (compilation blocked)

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. STOP all new feature development
2. Fix critical compilation errors first
3. Enable pre-commit compilation checks
4. Get test suite running again

SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks):
5. Complete WIP modules or remove them
6. Restore test coverage to ≥80%
7. Enable CI/CD quality gates
8. Document MCP compliance status

LONG-TERM (Next Month):
9. Technical debt refactoring
10. Performance baseline restoration
11. Security audit completion
12. Documentation update

=== HONEST ASSESSMENT ===

Readiness Level: 0/10

This project is NOT READY for:
- Production deployment
- MCP compliance certification
- Public release
- Integration testing

What Works:
- Project structure
- Test framework (when code compiles)
- Documentation
- Historical benchmark data

What Doesn't Work:
- Core compilation (BROKEN)
- Security validator (NON-FUNCTIONAL)
- Tests (CANNOT RUN)
- Compliance verification (BLOCKED)
- Performance measurement (IMPOSSIBLE)

Recommendation: DO NOT DEPLOY
Fix compilation errors before any other work.

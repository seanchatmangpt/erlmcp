  - **Fault-Tolerant**: Designed with the "let it crash" philosophy for self-healing systems
  - **Distributed**: Built-in clustering with automatic node discovery and load balancing
  - **Secure**: Zero-trust architecture with role-based access control and encryption
  - **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing with OpenTelemetry
  - **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-grade with comprehensive testing and documentation

  ## Use Cases
  - AI/ML model serving at scale
  - Real-time inference with high throughput
  - Distributed AI coordination and management
  - Mission-critical MCP applications requiring 99.95%+ uptime
  - Complex distributed systems with strong consistency requirements

  ## Technical Details
  - **Runtime**: Erlang/OTP 28.3.1 with native clustering
  - **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) JSON-RPC 2.0
  - **Distribution**: EPMD-less clustering with TLS encryption
  - **Monitoring**: Cloud Operations Suite integration
  - **Security**: OAuth2/OIDC, SAML 2.0, RBAC/ABAC/PBAC

  ## Deployment Options
  - **Cloud Run**: Serverless deployment with auto-scaling (99.9% SLA)

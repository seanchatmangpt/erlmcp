  AGENT 09: QUICK TESTS - FAILURE REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Status: ❌ FAIL
Duration: 17s

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Test modules are not being compiled by rebar3. The test files exist
in apps/*/test/ directories but rebar3 is not compiling them into beam
files that can be executed.

Technical Details:
------------------
- Test files exist: apps/erlmcp_core/test/*_tests.erl (200+ files)
- Include files exist: apps/erlmcp_core/include/erlmcp.hrl
- Compiled beams NOT found: _build/test/**/*_tests.beam (missing)
- Error: 'Module not found in project'

Root Cause Analysis:
--------------------
In this umbrella project structure, rebar3 is not configured to compile
test files from the apps/*/test/ directories. The test profile needs
explicit configuration to:
1. Include test directories in compilation path
2. Add proper include paths for headers
3. Make compiled test beams available to eunit

SOLUTION REQUIRED:
------------------
Option 1: Add per-app rebar.config files with test profile
Option 2: Modify top-level rebar.config to include test_dirs
Option 3: Use Common Test (.SUITE files) instead of EUnit
Option 4: Add test compilation rules to project structure

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Fix rebar.config to properly compile test files
2. Re-run ./scripts/test/quick.sh
3. Validate all quick tests pass
4. Store results via hooks

Work Order Status: BLOCKED - Build configuration issue

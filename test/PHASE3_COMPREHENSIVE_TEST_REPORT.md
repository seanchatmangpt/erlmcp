## Test Quality and Validation Approach

### Production Validation Principles Applied
1. **Real System Integration**: Tests use actual network connections, registry systems, and process communication
2. **No Mock Dependencies in Core Logic**: Only test infrastructure uses mocks; core transport logic tested against real systems
3. **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete message flow testing from transport to registry to server
4. **Performance Under Load**: High-volume and concurrent operation testing
5. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fault injection and recovery testing

### Test Categories by Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 40% - Individual function and component testing
- **Integration Tests**: 35% - Multi-component interaction testing
- **System Tests**: 15% - End-to-end transport system validation
- **Performance Tests**: 10% - Load, stress, and performance benchmarking
